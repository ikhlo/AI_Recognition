# AI_Recognition
AI project about gender recognition using computer vision and deep learning.


## Launch the code :

You can test the code with the gender_recognition_cv.py file. Clone this repository and go inside it. Open cmd, powershell or any other bash and tap the following. 

```
python gender_recognition_cv.py
```

Some warning messages may appear and the your webcam will open itself automatically. Be aware that you need python software and install all dependencies : tensorflow, numpy, cvlib and cv2.


## This project is implemented in Python and gathers tasks of :
* Web scrapping : getting and storing data from a wesite and Google images.
* Neural network modelisation on the Jupyter Notebook.
* Using the final model with Computer vision.
  

## You will find in this repositery : 
* The [Scrapping function](https://github.com/ikhlo/AI_Recognition/blob/main/script_dataset.py)
* The [Modelling Notebook](https://github.com/ikhlo/AI_Recognition/blob/main/gender_recognition_Notebook.ipynb)
* The [lauching computer vision function](https://github.com/ikhlo/AI_Recognition/blob/main/gender_recognition_cv.py)
